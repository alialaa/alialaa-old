This is an article that [I wrote in 2017 on medium](https://codeburst.io/how-i-created-a-simple-game-with-expo-react-native-redux-cf4f0580f7f3). The dependencies used might be outdated; however, It might still be useful to take a look at. At the time I wrote this article, [expo](https://expo.io/) was relatively new and I was working with it on a big react native project and I thought it was completely magical. So I decided to try and create a simple game using expo and it turned out OK. In this article I shed some light on my experience creating the game. [You can find the article here.](https://codeburst.io/how-i-created-a-simple-game-with-expo-react-native-redux-cf4f0580f7f3) Here's a demo of the final outcome:
