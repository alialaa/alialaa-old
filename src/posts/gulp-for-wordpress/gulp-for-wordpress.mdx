This is a two-part series that I wrote for CSS Tricks on creating a Gulp workflow for WordPress theme development. The first part covers a lot of ground for the initial setup, including Gulp installation and an outline of the tasks we want it to run. The second part goes deep into the tasks Gulp will run by breaking down what each task does and how to tailor them to streamline theme development.

Here are the links where you can read the two parts on CSS Tricks:
