                    <li>
                        I use a MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015), 2.5 GHz Quad-Core Intel
                        Core i7, 16 GB memory. It works fine for recording. Sometimes however,
                        especially during summer when it&apos;s hot, the fan speed gets a bit high.
                        That of course gets into the voice recording and then I have to deal with it
                        when post-processing the voice.

                    <li>
                        I don&apos;t record my laptop&apos;s screen directly. I have an{" "}

                        </a>{" "}
                        connected to the laptop. I use the laptop&apos;s screen for looking at
                        finished code or notes while recording. Although the laptop&apos;s screen
                        resolution is higher than the monitor&apos;s, I chose to record the monitor
                        since I don&apos;t need a higher resolution than 1080p. Recording the laptop
                        results in unnecessarily large files.
                    </li>

                        For screen recording and editing I use{" "}

                        I got for a good price using a promo code. However when I needed to upgrade
                        to the newest verison I found out that ScreenFlow is almost half the price
                        and it does everything that I want.

                        I have recently been recording using a{" "}

                        is also responsible for attaching the mic to the desk using the{" "}

                        that I used to use a{" "}

                        </a>
                        . It was a great choice given its price, but the R√òDE NT1 is much more
                        superior.

                        for post-processing my voice recordings. I do things like noise reduction,

                        (as seen in the picture above). However it didn&apos;t work for me, I
                        probably needed a lot of them in order to have an effect. I just tried
                        moving my desk into a more &quot;furniture crammed&quot; place and the echo
                        was significantly less.
