Welcome to the complete guide to building premium WordPress themes. In this course you'll learn how to code

1
00:12.090 --> 00:18.540
WordPress themes using best practices, coding standards and advanced workflows.

2
00:19.080 --> 00:22.890
My name is Ali and I will be instructing you throughout this course.

3
00:23.070 --> 00:25.790
Years ago I discovered my love for web development.

4
00:26.190 --> 00:33.670
I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and then I became obsessed with WordPress themes. I saw amazing stuff people created

5
00:33.690 --> 00:40.860
websites like Theme Forest and I decided I'm going to learn this and publish my own themes. After a series

6
00:40.860 --> 00:42.660
of failures and rejections,

7
00:42.900 --> 00:48.150
I was able to get themes and plugins published on Theme Forest and that gave me a lot of experience

8
00:48.460 --> 00:51.240
that I decided to share with you in this course.

9
00:51.450 --> 00:57.060
This course is made for anybody seeking to code their great designs into premium WordPress themes that

10
00:57.060 --> 01:01.190
are guaranteed to get accepted on marketplaces like Theme Forest.

11
01:01.500 --> 01:07.950
After completing this course you will not only be able to create secure, translation ready and feature packed themes

12
01:08.460 --> 01:14.340
but you'll also have a deep understanding on how WordPress works. During the course we will create a theme

13
01:14.340 --> 01:16.050
from scratch.

14
01:16.050 --> 01:21.030
First we will start by discussing some important theoretical topics that you should know before getting

15
01:21.030 --> 01:22.470
deeper into coding a theme.

16
01:23.160 --> 01:28.620
We will use diagrams and visualizations to help you understand concepts that we will use throughout

17
01:28.620 --> 01:29.940
the entire theme.

18
01:30.390 --> 01:35.760
Then we will spend some time writing some JavaScript that will help us automate some repetitive tasks

19
01:36.150 --> 01:42.350
like compiling SASS to CSS, minifying CSS and JavaScript and many more.

20
01:42.600 --> 01:48.090
After that we will dig deeper into our theme and in each section we will add a new major feature.

21
01:50.740 --> 01:55.940
To take this course ideally you should be an existing web developer familiar with WordPress.

22
01:56.440 --> 02:01.070
But don't worry if you have no prior work experience it's not a problem.

23
02:01.270 --> 02:03.980
We will create everything from scratch.

24
02:04.000 --> 02:09.500
You should however be good at HTML, CSS and JavaScript and also PHP.

25
02:09.800 --> 02:16.330
You should at least have an idea about PHP variables, constants, functions, classes, objects, arrays and so on.

26
02:16.360 --> 02:24.520
This is not a design, CSS, HTML or PHP course. I will mainly focus on WordPress functionality.

27
02:24.850 --> 02:29.290
So make sure to read the course description for more information about that and also take a look at

28
02:29.290 --> 02:32.660
the course curriculum and looking forward to see you inside.
