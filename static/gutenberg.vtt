Welcome to Gutenberg blocks for WordPress and ReactJS developers. In this course you'll learn everything

1
00:10.630 --> 00:15.660
you need to know to create complex Gutenberg blocks and plugins from scratch.

2
00:16.000 --> 00:19.910
My name is Ali and I will be instructing you throughout this course.

3
00:20.020 --> 00:26.290
I've been working as a front-end web developer for years. Creating WordPress themes and plugins and also JavaScript

4
00:26.380 --> 00:29.680
and ReactJS Web applications.

5
00:29.680 --> 00:36.310
This course is designed for WordPress developers who are familiar with ReactJS and Redux and need

6
00:36.310 --> 00:40.660
to learn everything about the new Gutenberg editor in WordPress.

7
00:40.660 --> 00:45.640
At the end of this course you should be able to use React and Redux in order to create complex

8
00:45.640 --> 00:52.240
Gutenberg blocks from scratch and also add features to the existing Gutenberg UI.

9
00:52.240 --> 00:52.990
Before creating any blocks

10
00:52.990 --> 00:57.310
we will discuss some design guidelines that you should follow when designing a block.

11
00:57.940 --> 01:02.770
We will also take a look at how Gutenberg works behind the scenes and how your post is saved in the

12
01:02.770 --> 01:05.020
database and so on.

13
01:05.470 --> 01:11.600
Then we will have a webpack tutorial and that will help us compile and bundle our JavaScript and CSS

14
01:11.620 --> 01:14.590
files in our Gutenberg plugin.

15
01:14.590 --> 01:20.830
Next we will create our Gutenberg WordPress plugin where we will start by creating simple block.

16
01:21.130 --> 01:25.300
And then as we build up some knowledge, we will start creating more complex blocks.

17
01:25.900 --> 01:32.920
So from a very simple text block to a nested team members block where you can add team member blocks

18
01:33.460 --> 01:40.800
and each block will have an image some text and social media links where you can drag and drop to re-order.

19
01:40.810 --> 01:47.890
We will also create a dynamic block which is a block that generates dynamic content and not just some

20
01:47.890 --> 01:49.890
static HTML.

21
01:50.470 --> 01:52.710
We will explore Redux in Gutenberg.

22
01:52.780 --> 01:58.780
How to use existing Redux stores and also how to create our own stores if we need to share some state

23
01:58.810 --> 02:00.100
between multiple blocks.

24
02:01.120 --> 02:07.410
Finally we will learn different ways that we can use in order to manage metadata in Gutenberg.

25
02:07.480 --> 02:14.200
We will learn how to extend Gutenberg's UI and add some options in the sidebar to manage our metadata.

26
02:15.190 --> 02:15.790
During the course

27
02:15.790 --> 02:24.280
we will also integrate ESLint, Prettier and Husky in order to have an improved workflow.

28
02:24.280 --> 02:26.530
In order to get the most out of this course,

29
02:26.710 --> 02:33.970
you need to have some WordPress development experience. JavaScript, preferably ES6 and later versions 

30
02:34.560 --> 02:35.560
is also required.

31
02:36.850 --> 02:43.690
You should also be familiar with the ReactJS. So concepts like components, state, lifecycle methods and

32
02:43.690 --> 02:47.630
other basic React concepts should not be new to you.

33
02:48.200 --> 02:48.730
Redux knowledge

34
02:48.730 --> 02:50.680
is also ideal.

35
02:50.680 --> 02:53.310
Not all blocks will require using Redux.

36
02:53.440 --> 02:58.150
However in some blocks we will use Redux heavily. So it would be ideal

37
02:58.330 --> 03:04.800
if you are familiar with Redux concepts like stores, actions, action creators and reducers.

38
03:05.500 --> 03:12.130
So make sure to take a look at the course description and also the free preview videos and I look forward

39
03:12.130 --> 03:13.360
to seeing you inside.
